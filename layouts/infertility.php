                <h1>What is Infertility?</h1>
                <p class="custom-justify">Infertility is the inability to conceive after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse. It affects both men and women and can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances, reproductive organ issues, or underlying medical conditions. Lifestyle choices, age, and stress can also contribute to infertility. Diagnosis typically involves medical tests and evaluations to determine the root cause. Treatment options range from medication and lifestyle changes to assisted reproductive technologies like IVF. Early intervention can improve the chances of successful conception.</p>
